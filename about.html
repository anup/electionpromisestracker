      In a democracy, the faith voters repose in their representatives and the political institutions is sacrosanct. It is this faith that keeps the democracy alive. Hence, preserving this faith becomes important.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Election Promises Tracker</strong> enables voters to monitor the performance of their governments. It will fact-check claims of the politicians and the governments. It will also assess if governments adhere to all of their promises in regard to education, health, law and order, minority rights, culture, human rights, and many more. 
      <br /><br />
      However, we begin small by presenting the Education Report Card of 2 Years of Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi. The ultimate goal of this portal is to track EVERY single promise of EVERY single government in this country.Â
