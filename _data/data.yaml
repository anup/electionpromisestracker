        title: Regulate Private School Fees
        statement: AAP committed to regulating private school fees by publishing the fee structures and accounts online. AAP also committed to abolishing the capitation fee.
        state: In November 2015, Delhi Legislative Assembly passed two bills namely Delhi School (Verification of Accounts and Refund of Excess Fee) Bill, 2015 and ‘Delhi School Education (Amendment) Bill, 2015’. The bills make provision for publishing the fee structures and accounts of all the schools online as well as abolishes capitation fee. The bills lay down the criterion for fee hike and a Committee headed by retired High Court Judge to verify the accounts of the schools. However, 15 months since passed by the Legislative Assembly, the bills await the assent of Lieutenant Governor and Central Government. Despite this, the government has effectively regulated the fee hikes and acted swiftly against schools that violated norms causing them to refund the excess fee to the parents.

        title: Five Hundred New Schools & Infrastructure Improvement in Schools
        statement: AAP promised to open 500 new schools with special focus on secondary and senior secondary schools.
        state: Number of schools have increased from 1007 in 2014-15 to 1030 in 2017-18. In addition to this, the Government is in process of constructing more than 8,000 new classrooms, most of which are nearing completion now. If 60 rooms were to equate with constructing one school, the Government of Delhi will have constructed 135 schools in a few months from now. Also, since there is a double shift concept of schools, the number of schools (in equivalent terms) would be equal to 270. The 2017-18 budget documents show that the government has sanctioned construction of 10,000 more classrooms (165 schools in equivalent terms). This will take the number of schools (in equivalent terms) to 600 when the construction work is complete.
